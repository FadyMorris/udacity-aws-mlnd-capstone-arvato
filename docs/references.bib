	abstract = {Customer retention is considered as one of the important concerns for many companies and ﬁnancial institutions like banks, telecommunication service providers, investment services, insurance and retail sectors. Recent marketing indicators and metrics show that attracting and gaining new customers or subscribers is much more expensive and difﬁcult than retaining existing ones. Therefore, losing a customer or a subscriber will negatively impact the growth and the proﬁtability if the company. In this work, we propose a customer retention model based on one of the most powerful machine learning classiﬁers which is XGBoost. The latter classiﬁer is experimented when combined wit different oversampling methods to improve its performance in the used imbalanced dataset. The experimental results show very promising results compared to other well-known classiﬁers.},

Most companies are trying to market precisely through customer segmentation in order to reduce the rate of customer churn. Aiming at the customer characteristics of social network e-commerce, this paper builds a customer value model that integrates the value of social network to help companies subdivides the customer accurately. Then we use the machine learning algorithm XG-Boost to predict the churn of customers before and after the subdivision. The research found that the prediction accuracy is higher after customer segmentation. In addition, the XG-Boost algorithm is more advantageous than other algorithms.},

	abstract = {Function approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest--descent minimization. A general gradient--descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least--squares, least--absolute--deviation, and Huber--M loss functions for regression, and multi--class logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are decision trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of decision trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire 1996, and Fr...},
